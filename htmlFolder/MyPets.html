        <p>Im also a girl, and i love all 4 seasons, but my favorite ones are winter and summer. I really like the cold white snow! It's sooo fluffy! And my owner also likes buying me lots of coats and accesories! I usually have lots of walks in the park at summer, and we also go to the dog park for training! I love when my owner gives me treats just for jumping over an obsticle. </p>

        <p>I also really like sleeping on my owners bed instead of mine lol. But mine is comfy too! I just like cuddles at night. I also have a friend! Her name is Darsy, and she is a cat! I always play with her, share my toys and even play tag! And i think she likes it. We will be bestfriends soon! =></p>

      <div class="CatsInfo">
        <p>I also sleep most time of the day, but when a four leg black cute creature sees me sleeping, it's  a must for her to jump on me and wake me up! I usually find new spots to hide and take a quick nap, but she always finds me! She has a great sense of smell but that's not rlly good for me. She also brings her toys and runs after me when I go somewhere, wierd right? But she is still a pup, she will grow up soon. And her name is Nancy! =)
